# Week 1

90 minutes

## Introduction

- Introduce all the helpers.
- What we hope you will get out of the code club:
  - A basic understanding of how you make a web page with HTML, and how you can
    style it with CSS
  - The ability to understand technical conversations a bit better
- How the code club will work:
  - you can complete the exercises for the week's module at your own pace,
    either during the weekly sessions or in your own time
  - if you get stuck, we'll come help you out
  - if you finish the week's exercise, we'll help you experiment with the things
    you've just learned
  - you can pair with others if you want
- This is an alpha. Things will probably not go according to plan but as
  organisers we want to learn as much as we can.
- Set up your Codecademy account
  - We’re using the 'pupil tracker' feature to create everyone’s accounts
