# GDS code club curriculum

This is a collection of lesson plans for the code club at GDS.

We developed these as we ran the initial code club in late 2014. We've iterated
them a bit since, based on what worked and what didn't.

They mainly build from the
[Codecademy HTML/CSS track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web).
